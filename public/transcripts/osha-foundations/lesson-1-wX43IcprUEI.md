# Module 1: Introduction to OSHA and the Occupational Safety and Health Act

## Transcript

Welcome, fellow learners. Today, we will dive deep into the world of workplace safety.

As you know, OSHA has a 10-hour course for workers. However, completing this course can be somewhat difficult if you have not prepared for it. But do not worry. We have developed an incredible study guide that will make passing this course a piece of cake.

That is right, the **OSHA Outreach 10-Hour Construction Study Guide** is here to make your compliance journey easy and convenient.

This guide has **11 modules**, and we will explore each of these modules in a series of videos. Subscribe now and press the bell icon to get updated.

## Module 1 Overview

The purpose of Module 1 is to provide workers with introductory information about OSHA. This includes:

- OSHA history and mission  
- Worker rights  
- Employer responsibilities under OSHA standards  
- OSHA inspections  
- Safety and health resources, including how to file an OSHA complaint  

This module is beneficial for anyone directly or indirectly involved with OSHA and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

## Important Key Terms

**MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)**  
A document that contains hazard-related information about a specific chemical or formulation.

**OSHA**  
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

**PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)**  
Includes hard hats, gloves, boots, eye protection, and respiratory aids.

## Lesson 1: Why Is OSHA Important to You?

### Key Points

OSHA was created because, prior to 1970, there were no specific laws to protect workers' rights or establish workplace safety standards.

Since OSHA was established, workplace accidents and fatalities have declined by more than 60 percent, and injuries and illnesses have decreased by 40 percent.

Some states operate OSHA-approved **State Plans** that cover state-specific standards and local government workers. These programs respond to accidents and safety complaints and conduct unannounced inspections, similar to federal OSHA.

OSHA approves and monitors all State Plans. These plans must be at least as effective as federal OSHA requirements. Twenty-two states and territories operate complete plans, and four cover only the public sector.

The estimated annual cost of occupational injuries and illnesses ranges from **145 billion to 290 billion dollars**, including direct and indirect costs.

### Workplace Injury Statistics

- On average, 15 workers die every day from job-related injuries.  
- Over 5,600 Americans die annually from workplace injuries.  
- Each year, more than 4 million non-fatal workplace injuries and illnesses are reported.

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 2: What Rights Do You Have Under OSHA?

### Key Points

Workers have the right to review injury and illness logs. This includes former employees, personal representatives, and authorized employee representatives.

OSHA regulations protect workers who report unsafe or unhealthful conditions. You cannot be transferred, denied a raise, have your hours reduced, be fired, or punished for exercising your rights under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Because workers are often closest to safety and health hazards, reporting problems helps ensure they are corrected. If hazards are not addressed, workers should contact OSHA.

The Occupational Safety and Health Act protects employees from retaliation for reporting concerns, initiating proceedings, requesting OSHA information, or testifying under the Act. In limited cases, employees may refuse to work in dangerous conditions.

If you believe you have been punished for exercising your rights, you must contact OSHA within **30 days**.

If you file a complaint, you have the right to learn OSHA’s response and request a review if no inspection occurs.

Workers may speak privately with an OSHA inspector, point out hazards, describe injuries or near misses, and raise safety or health concerns.

"Good faith" means that even if imminent danger is not found, the worker reasonably believed it existed. Because work refusal requirements are strict, refusing work should be a last resort.

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 3: What Responsibilities Does Your Employer Have Under OSHA?

### Key Points

Employers must implement PPE programs that address:

- Workplace hazards  
- Selection, maintenance, and use of PPE  
- Employee training  
- Program monitoring for ongoing effectiveness  

Employers are required to determine when PPE is necessary to protect workers.

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 4: What Do the OSHA Standards Say?

### Key Points

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is divided into titles, and OSHA standards are found in **Title 29**.

Within each part, such as **Part 1926**, standards are organized into subparts. For example, **Subpart C**, titled *General Safety and Health Provisions*, includes sections 1926.20 through 1926.35.

All OSHA standards are available on OSHA’s website and can be searched by standard number or topic.

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 5: How Are OSHA Inspections Conducted?

### Key Points

OSHA inspections are conducted without advance notice, except in rare cases such as imminent danger situations. Anyone who provides advance notice of an inspection may face fines or jail time.

Referrals often come from government agencies such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health or local health departments and are handled like complaints.

Follow-up inspections may be conducted to verify that cited violations were corrected.

Monitoring inspections ensure worker protection when hazards require extended correction time.

Certified Health and Safety Officers may interview workers, take photographs or videos, and monitor exposure to hazards. Interviews are conducted privately, though workers may request union representation.

Citations are mailed no later than **six months** after the inspection.

The Area Director reviews inspection findings and determines citations and penalties.

OSHA may reduce penalties based on:

- Severity of the violation  
- Employer good faith  
- History of violations  
- Business size  

Employers and workers can contest citations, though employers have broader rights. Employers may request informal conferences or settlement agreements. Both parties may participate in hearings and request further review.

If an employer contests a violation or abatement date, correction is delayed until a final legal order is issued. If only the penalty is contested, the violation must still be corrected by the cited date.

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 6: Where Can You Go for Help?

### Key Points

OSHA standards require bilingual signs and labels for hazard communication, egress, confined spaces, and bloodborne pathogens.

Orientation manuals and training materials should explain how to work safely.

If you have questions about new or changed tasks, request written procedures and additional training.

When discussing health concerns with a healthcare provider, share detailed information about chemical exposures, including names and MSDSs or labels.

Discrimination related to health and safety activities is illegal. Union representatives may include their names on complaints.

Now, review the study questions.
