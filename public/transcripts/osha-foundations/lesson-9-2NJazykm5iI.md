# Module 7: Stairways and Ladders

## Transcript

Welcome back, fellow learners, to the final rung of this enlightening study guide.

Let’s take a moment for a quick recap of the previous module. We covered scaffolds tailored for specific jobs, including the **trestle scaffold**, a low portable scaffold with supporting legs, ideal for interior work or tasks at lower heights.

Now, as we have come so far and are about to start the final module, I invite you to join us by hitting that **subscribe** button and ringing the **bell icon**. A word of advice: make sure you’ve caught up on the gems shared in the previous modules.

Now, let’s open the doors to this module, where we’ll shine a spotlight on **stairways and ladders**.

These seemingly ordinary elements are major contributors to workplace injuries and fatalities, especially in construction.

According to OSHA estimates, **24,882 injuries and 36 fatalities** occur each year due to falls from stairways and ladders across various industries. Behind these numbers are real people and real lives impacted. Almost half of these injuries are serious and may result in significant time away from the job.

This module unfolds across three vital lessons:

1. OSHA standards and stairways  
2. Ladders and training  
3. Safety measures

## Key Terms

**Double cleat ladder**  
A ladder designed with a center rail that supports safer traffic flow for employees ascending and descending.

**Failure**  
Includes load refusal, breakage, or separation of components.

**Fixed ladder**  
A ladder that is permanently attached to a structure or building.

**Handrail**  
A rail system designed to provide a handhold for employees.

**Job-made ladder**  
A ladder that is not commercially manufactured and is made by employees at the construction site.

**Point of access**  
All areas used by employees for work-related passage from one area or level to another.

**Portable ladder**  
A ladder that can be moved or carried.

**Single cleat ladder**  
A ladder consisting of side rails and cleats, rungs, or steps.

**Stair rail system**  
A system along the unprotected sides and edges of a stairway to prevent falls to lower levels.

**Tread depth**  
The horizontal distance from the front to the back of a stair tread.

## Lesson 1: OSHA Standards and Stairways

Welcome to the first lesson: OSHA standards and stairways.

At points of access where the elevation between two steps is **19 inches or more**, employers must provide a stairway or ladder. This is mandatory.

In areas where doors or gates open directly to a stairway, a platform at least **20 inches wide** must be provided to help prevent falls.

Stairway landings must be at least **30 inches deep** and **22 inches wide**, and must be provided at every **12 feet or less** of vertical rise.

Guardrail systems must be provided when a platform has a swinging door and there is a potential fall of **6 feet or more**.

For stairways with **four or more risers**, or stairways rising more than **30 inches**, handrails must be provided.

Stair rail systems must be used on exposed sides where there is a potential fall of **6 feet or more**.

Handrails and top rails must be able to withstand a force of **200 pounds**.

If the top edge also functions as a handrail, the height must be between **36 and 37 inches**.

For grandfathered staircases, stair rail heights may vary between **34 and 30 inches**.

Now, review the study questions to test your understanding.

## Lesson 2: Ladders and Training

Here comes the second lesson: ladders and training.

Always use ladders for their designed purposes. Do not lash ladders together to create a makeshift extension unless they are specifically designed for that use.

Never exceed the manufacturer’s rated capacity.

Before use, inspect portable ladders for cracks, dents, and missing rungs. Keep ladders in safe working condition.

When using ladders, side rails should be at least **11.5 inches apart**.

Never use the top or top step of a stepladder as a standing surface.

If a ladder is defective, tag it clearly with **“Do not use.”**

When working near electricity, use ladders with **nonconductive side rails**.

Use **double cleated ladders** for access and exit points, especially when 25 or more employees are using the ladder as a means of access or egress.

For non-self-supporting ladders, position the ladder so the top support to foot distance is **one quarter of the working length**.

When a portable ladder is used to reach an upper landing surface, side rails must extend at least **3 feet** above the landing.

Fixed ladders must support **two loads of 250 pounds each**, and must account for added loads such as ice buildup, winds, rigging, and impacts.

Now, review the study questions to deepen your understanding.

Next, we’ll review ladder incidents and prepare for the final lesson.

## Lesson 3: Safety Measures

Now, let’s shift to the final lesson: safety measures.

### Key Points

**Ladder strength**  
Each non-self-supporting ladder must support at least **four times** the maximum intended load when the ladder is placed at a **75.5-degree** angle from horizontal.

**Fixed ladder strength**  
Fixed ladders must support two loads of **250 pounds** each, concentrated between any two consecutive attachments, plus expected loads from ice buildup, winds, rigging, and impacts from ladder safety devices.

**Toe clearance**  
Maintain a minimum toe clearance of **7 inches**. When necessary, clearance may be reduced, but not below **4.5 inches**.

**Obstructions**  
When unavoidable, reduce perpendicular clearance to **24 inches** and use a deflection device to guide the climber around the obstruction.

**Fall protection**  
Fixed ladders extending beyond **24 feet** must include personal fall protection systems, cages, or wells.

**Rest platforms**  
For climbs exceeding **150 feet**, fixed ladders must provide rest platforms every 150 feet. Each platform must be at least **18 inches by 24 inches**.

Now, review the study questions.

## Common Causes of Ladder Accidents

Ladder accidents often result from a lack of safety precautions. Common causes include:

- Incorrect ladder placement on uneven or unstable surfaces  
- Using defective or damaged ladders  
- Exceeding weight capacity  
- Inadequate training  

---

## Essential Safety Tips

- Inspect ladders regularly and fix defects promptly. Remove damaged ladders from service.
- Ensure stable, secure ladder placement. Use levelers and stabilizers when needed.
- Keep stairways clear and obstacle-free. Ensure exits are well-marked.
- Use proper signage to identify stairways, exits, and hazards.
- Do not move ladders side to side while someone is on them. Descend first, relocate second.
- Provide regular safety training. Knowledge is power, and in this case, knowledge is safety.
