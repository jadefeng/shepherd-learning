# Module 3: Health Hazards and Hazard Communication

## Transcript

Welcome back, fellow learners.

In this video, we will begin **Module 3**. Before we continue, be sure to subscribe for upcoming modules. If you have not watched the previous modules, please do so first for a better understanding.

## Module 3 Overview

Module 3 is divided into two sections:

- **Module 3A:** OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Z  
- **Module 3B:** OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart D  

---

## Module 3A: OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Z  
### Health Hazards and Hazard Communication

We will first discuss **Module 3A**, which focuses on **Health Hazards and Hazard Communication**.

The **Hazard Communication Standard (HCS)** informs workers and employers about chemical hazards in the workplace and the protective measures that can be taken to prevent adverse health effects.

This section provides a basic understanding of how to work with hazardous chemicals and how workers can protect themselves.

---

## Module 3A Lessons

1. Introduction to the Hazard Communication Standard  
2. Labels, MSDSs, Symbols, Hazards, and Training  

---

## Essential Key Terms

**Chemical**  
Any element, compound, or mixture of elements or compounds.

**Combustible**  
A material with a flash point of 100°F or above.

**Flammable**  
A material with a flash point below 100°F.

**HAZCOM**  
Hazard Communication Standard.

**Inhalation**  
Breathing in airborne substances such as gases, fumes, mists, vapors, dust, or aerosols.

**Training**  
A course of study in which employees are instructed to identify and work safely with hazardous materials.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to the Hazard Communication Standard

### Key Points

- **Exposure** means an employee is subjected, as a condition of employment, to a chemical that presents a physical or health hazard, including potential or accidental exposure.
- Health hazard exposure includes all routes of entry, such as inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, absorption, or injection.
- A **hazard warning** consists of words, pictures, symbols, or combinations that communicate physical or health hazards, including target organ effects.
- **Immediate use** means a hazardous chemical is used only by the person who transferred it from a labeled container and only within the same workshift.
- Any hazardous material transferred from a primary container to a secondary container must have labeling information transferred as well.
- An **organic peroxide** is a carbon-containing compound with two oxygen atoms bonded together.
- **Pyrophoric** chemicals ignite spontaneously in air at or below 130°F (54.4°C).
- **Unstable reactive chemicals** may polymerize, decompose, condense, or become self-reactive under shock, pressure, or temperature conditions.
- **Water-reactive chemicals** react with water to release flammable gases or gases that present a health hazard.
- Workers have the right to know the identities and hazards of the chemicals they are exposed to while performing their duties.

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 2: Labels, MSDSs, Symbols, Hazards, and Training

### Key Points

- All hazardous chemical containers must be labeled. Labels are the most immediate source of hazard information.
- Chemical manufacturers often include safe handling procedures on labels; however, employers must translate MSDS information into an understandable format.
- Employers must communicate chemical hazards before employees are exposed.
- Manufacturers or importers must update MSDSs within **three months** of discovering new hazard information.
- DOT hazard class shipping labels indicate specific hazards; the MSDS provides detailed hazard information.
- Employees must be trained before working with hazardous materials.
- Water-reactive materials can react violently or explode when exposed to water.
- Unstable reactive materials can become self-reactive when exposed to pressure, temperature, or shock.
- Workers should monitor themselves and coworkers for symptoms such as dizziness, eye or throat irritation, or skin rashes.
- Any symptoms of possible exposure must be reported immediately to a supervisor.
- Always use required PPE such as gloves, aprons, masks, or respirators as specified on labels or MSDSs.

Now, review the study questions.

## Module 3B: OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart D  
### Health Hazards in Construction

This section applies to workers in the construction industry who may encounter health hazards or chemicals while performing their duties.

---

## Essential Key Terms

**Container**  
Any bag, barrel, bottle, box, can, cylinder, drum, reaction vessel, or storage tank containing a hazardous chemical.

**Explosive**  
A chemical that causes a sudden release of pressure, gas, and heat when subjected to shock, pressure, or high temperature.

**Physical Hazard**  
A chemical with scientifically valid evidence that it is combustible, flammable, explosive, a compressed gas, organic peroxide, oxidizer, pyrophoric, unstable reactive, or water reactive.

**Trade Secret**  
Confidential business information that provides an employer with a competitive advantage.

## Lesson: Hazardous Materials

### Key Points

- Employee exposure to respirable silica dust (quartz) must not exceed **0.1 micrograms per cubic meter**, averaged over an 8-hour workshift.
- **Silicosis** can cause severe breathing difficulty, disability, lung cancer, or death. Symptoms may include loss of appetite, fever, and weight loss.
- Inhaling loose asbestos fibers can cause fatal diseases such as lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.
- Symptoms of asbestos-related diseases may not appear for **20 years or more** after initial exposure.
- Short-term asbestos exposure must not exceed **one fiber per cubic centimeter**, averaged over 30 minutes.
- Rotating employees to meet exposure limits is prohibited.
- Asbestos can be carried home on clothing, putting family members at risk.
- Workers are not always informed when asbestos is present, and even low-level exposure can cause harm.
- No employee may be exposed to **MDA** above:
  - **10 parts per billion (ppb)** as an 8-hour time-weighted average  
  - **100 ppb** over a 15-minute short-term exposure period
- Decontamination areas must be established near regulated areas and include:
  - Equipment storage  
  - Washing facilities  
  - Clean change areas
- **Lead** exposure most commonly occurs through inhalation of dust, fumes, or mist, but can also occur through ingestion.

Now, review the study questions.
