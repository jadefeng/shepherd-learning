# Module 8: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

## Transcript

Welcome back, fellow learners, to a safety-first journey.

Before we proceed, let’s rewind for a quick recap of Module 7, focusing on fall protection and the importance of maintaining system integrity and reliability. Now it’s time to experience the life-saving power of fall protection in action.

As we gear up for Module 8, let me pause and emphasize the importance of hitting that **subscribe** button and ringing the **bell icon**. By doing so, you’ll stay at the forefront of invaluable insights. Also, make sure you’ve caught up on the previous modules. They serve as your guiding stars in this educational journey.

Now, let’s dive into **Module 8**, focusing on **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** from **OSHA 1926 Subpart E**.

The preciousness of every human life is emphasized in this module. Despite this, thousands of workers face fatalities due to negligence and inadequate safety measures, especially in the construction industry. Our goal here is to minimize or eliminate these tragedies.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration mandates employers to safeguard employees from workplace hazards using proper **engineering controls** or **work practices**. When these controls are not feasible, using **personal protective equipment** becomes crucial.

Our focus in this module is to provide a foundational understanding of OSHA’s pivotal role in preventing and eradicating work-related casualties and fatalities.

## Lesson 1: Protecting Employees From Workplace Hazards

Do you want to maximize protection for yourself and others in the workplace? To ensure maximum protection, employers and employees must collaborate to establish and maintain a safe work environment.

### Key Points

- Employers are responsible for:
  - Hazard assessment and identification  
  - Providing appropriate PPE  
  - Employee training  
  - PPE maintenance  
  - Regular program evaluations  

- According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), **three out of every five injured workers** were not wearing eye protection during their accidents.

- Employers must safeguard employees from:
  - Falling objects  
  - Hazardous substances  
  - Noise exposure  
  This should be done using engineering controls and, when necessary, PPE.

- Work practice controls (a form of administrative control) modify tasks to reduce risk.

- Employees must:
  - Follow PPE usage instructions  
  - Conduct daily inspections  
  - Ensure compatibility when multiple PPE types are used together  
  - Understand glove selection based on tasks and material resistance  

- Proper training on PPE use is crucial. Retraining is needed if an employee has not gained the required skills.

- Training documentation is mandatory and must clearly include:
  - Certified employee’s name  
  - Training date  
  - Subject matter  

- Determining training adequacy and providing retraining when necessary are key elements of PPE usage.

Now, review the study questions to reinforce your understanding.

## Lesson 2: Head, Eye, Face, Hearing, Foot, Hand, and Body Protection

Let’s unravel some crucial points together.

### Head Protection

When it comes to safeguarding your head, there’s nothing quite like a hard hat. Let’s clear this up right away: **bump caps do not meet hard hat requirements.**

Hard hats come in three classes:

- **Class G (General):**  
  Designed to protect against impact and penetration from falling objects.  
  Rated for up to **2,200 volts** for low-voltage electrical protection.

- **Class E (Electrical):**  
  Provides increased resistance to high-voltage shocks up to **20,000 volts**.

- **Class C (Conductive):**  
  Often made from aluminum and designed for impact protection from falling objects and debris.  
  **Provides no electrical protection.**

### Eye and Face Protection

Safety is a mindset. When working around face and eye hazards, proper protection is non-negotiable.

- **Safety goggles:** Protect eyes from flying debris, harmful chemicals, and unexpected hazards.
- **Full face shields:** Protect the entire face from splashes, sparks, and potential impact.

### Hearing Protection

Hearing protection often goes unnoticed, but it’s essential:
- **Earplugs**
- **Ear muffs**

These protect against noise-induced hearing damage.

### Hand Protection

Hands are critical tools at work, so protecting them matters. Options include:
- Chemical-resistant gloves  
- Electrical-insulating gloves  
- Cut-resistant gloves  
- Leather gloves  
- Insulated gloves  

### Foot Protection

Protecting your feet is non-negotiable. Options include:
- Steel-toe boots  
- Composite-toe boots  
- Metatarsal guards  
- Electrical hazard boots  
- Slip-resistant boots  

Now, review the study questions to reinforce your understanding.

## Lesson 3: Choosing Personal Protective Equipment

Did you know that the leading cause of eye injuries is not wearing proper eye protection, or using inadequate gear?

### Key Points

- Goggles protect against impacts, dust, splashes, and even intense laser light concentrations.  
  Yes, **laser safety goggles** are a real thing.

- A key statistic: only **1% of nearly 770 workers** who suffered facial injuries were using face protection at the time.

### Respirators

Respirators cover the nose and mouth, or even the entire face and head, to keep airborne hazards out of the respiratory system.

Before an employer provides a respirator:
- A written plan must be in place.
- A healthcare professional must medically evaluate the employee.

Inspect your respirator every time you use it. If something seems off, get it fixed or replaced immediately.

### Welding Protection

A welding helmet or hand shield is essential for arc welding or cutting. Helpers and attendants also need proper eye protection.

### Noise Protection

Noise can be a sneaky hazard. OSHA sets limits around **90 dB** in construction. When noise exceeds **85 dBA**, employers must implement a hearing conservation program and provide proper protection.

### Gloves

When working with chemicals, choose gloves based on manufacturer recommendations, especially if your hands may come into contact with chemicals.

Hands are the second most injured body part in the workplace. Gloves also protect against:
- Rough edges  
- Extreme temperatures  
- Machinery risks  

### Safety Belts and Safety Nets

Safety belts and nets are critical fall protection systems. For more detail, review Module 7.

Safety nets must be tested and properly installed before work begins. Mesh size and impact resistance matter, and nets must meet specific standards to ensure effectiveness.

Now, review the study questions.

## PPE Statistics and Why It Matters

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only **31% of construction laborers** use PPE, leaving many workers vulnerable to preventable accidents.

OSHA emphasizes that proper PPE use can prevent nearly **38%** of occupational injuries or diseases. Tragically, **12% to 14%** of total disability-related injuries are attributed to employees not wearing the right protective gear.

Imagine the consequences:
- Hearing loss without earplugs or ear muffs  
- Lacerations to hands and fingers without gloves  
- Serious head injuries without hard hat protection  

But here’s the powerful truth: we can rewrite this story. Through awareness, education, and accessible, user-friendly PPE, we can transform these outcomes and build a future where safety becomes the norm.

## Essential PPE Tips

- Choose PPE that is appropriate for the specific hazards in your workplace.
- Educate yourself and your team on correct use, maintenance, and limitations of PPE.
- Check PPE regularly for damage, wear, and tear.
- Ensure proper fit and comfort. Follow manufacturer guidelines for sizing and adjustments.
- Store PPE in a clean, dry area to prevent damage or contamination.
- Encourage a culture of reporting issues or discomfort related to PPE.

Remember: PPE isn’t just equipment. It’s a promise of safety, a shield against adversity.
