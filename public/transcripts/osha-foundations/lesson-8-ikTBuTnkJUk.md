## Module Overview

Welcome to Module 10, an exciting and informative world of **scaffolds**.

Picture yourself on a scaffold at a considerable height without any safety precautions. Suddenly you feel the ground slipping beneath you, and the terrifying reality of losing your balance takes hold. Now imagine if you had proper protection in place: a safety net that could prevent this hazard.

Moments like these remind us of the critical importance of safety measures, especially when working at heights.

In this module, we will dive into the essentials of scaffold safety and provide a comprehensive understanding of the precautions required to create a safer work environment. We will also discuss diverse types of scaffolds and how to use them safely.

This module unfolds across three vital lessons:

1. Introduction to scaffolds  
2. Overview of OSHA directives for the construction of scaffolds  
3. Scaffold safety measures

## Key Terms

**Bearer (Putlog)**  
A horizontal transverse scaffold member supported by ledgers or runners. It supports the scaffold platform and connects scaffold uprights, posts, poles, and similar members.

**Boatswain’s Chair**  
A single-point adjustable suspension scaffold. A seat or sling designed to support one employee in a sitting position.

**Body Harness**  
A set of straps that secures an employee and distributes fall arrest forces over the thighs, pelvis, waist, chest, and shoulders. Includes means for attachment to other components of a personal fall arrest system.

**Brace**  
A rigid connection that holds one scaffold member in a fixed position with respect to another member or to the structure.

**Chimney Hoist**  
A multi-point adjustable suspension scaffold designed to provide access to work inside chimneys.

**Coupler**  
A device that locks together the tubes of a tube-and-coupler scaffold.

**Crawling Board**  
A supported scaffold resembling a plank with cleats that are spaced and secured. Used on sloped surfaces such as roofs.

**Maximum Intended Load**  
The total load of people, equipment, tools, materials, and other anticipated loads that a scaffold or its components can support at any one time.

**Outrigger**  
The structural support of a supported scaffold that increases base width and provides stability.

**Outrigger Beam (Thrustout)**  
A structural member that extends the scaffold’s point of attachment outward and away from the structure.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Scaffolds

Scaffolds are the unsung heroes of the construction industry. Think of them as the backbone of building, maintenance, and repair projects. These temporary structures provide the support and access workers need for tasks like painting, welding, and installing structures at elevated heights.

### Common Types of Scaffolds

**Frame Scaffolding**  
A versatile structure made of vertical and horizontal frames that creates a sturdy foundation for many construction projects.

**Suspended Scaffold (Swing Scaffold)**  
A scaffold that hangs from a fixed overhead support using ropes or other flexible means, with a platform supported by two bearers.

**Cup-Lock Scaffolding**  
Known for speed of assembly and adaptability, using a unique locking system with horizontal and vertical components.

**Catenary Scaffolds**  
Designed to follow the contours of a structure, ideal for irregular shapes or unique architectural features.

**Mobile Scaffolding**  
Mounted on wheels or casters, allowing easy movement for projects that require mobility.

**Tube-and-Coupler Scaffold**  
Highly versatile and can be built in various directions and combinations, but its adaptability can also present construction challenges.

### Scaffolds Tailored for Specific Jobs

**Trestle Scaffold**  
A low portable scaffold with supporting legs, commonly used for interior work or lower heights.

**Needle (Cantilever) Scaffold**  
Extends horizontally from a structure and is supported at one end. Useful when obstacles or restrictions exist at the base.

**Birdcage Scaffold**  
Surrounds large vertical structures and provides access to multiple levels, common in projects with vertical cores.

**H-Frame Scaffolding**  
A structure of vertical and horizontal frames often used in masonry work or when a large platform is needed.

**System Scaffold**  
Uses pre-engineered components with standardized connections, allowing versatile configurations and supporting complex or large-scale projects.

Now, review the study questions to test your understanding.

It’s time to identify the hazard. Have you found it? Comment below.

## Lesson 2: Overview of OSHA Directives for the Construction of Scaffolds

Let’s dive into essential points that form the backbone of scaffold safety and compliance.

### Key Points

**Two-point scaffold coverage**  
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, regulations outlined for two-point scaffolds also apply to other types of suspension scaffolds. This supports a universal approach to scaffold safety.

**Fall protection and guardrails**  
For any scaffold expected to be elevated more than **6 feet** above the ground, both **fall arrest systems** and **guardrails** must be provided.

**Clearance from electrical lines**  
Maintaining minimum clearance from electrical lines is critical:
- For lines up to **50 kV**, clearance must be **10 feet**
- If lines are insulated and carry less than **300 volts**, minimum clearance is **3 feet**

**Catenary scaffolds guidelines**  
- Limit interconnected platforms to **two**  
- Because guardrails are not standard, employees must use **personal fall arrest systems**

**Weight load and occupancy limits (catenary scaffolds)**  
- Maximum load: **500 pounds**  
- No more than **two people** on the scaffold at one time  
- Fully planked platforms must:
  - Have no more than **1-inch gaps**
  - Remain within **14 inches** of the structure being worked on

**Maximum platform height**  
Platforms may be placed up to **20 feet** above the supported base.

**Horizontal movement and pump jack guidelines**  
- Scaffolds should not be moved horizontally while employees are on them unless designed for that purpose.
- Pump jack wood must be straight-grained and free of shakes, dead knots, and defects.

As we conclude this segment, here are some study questions.

Now it’s time to see workers on scaffolds and comment on whether it is the right way to work on scaffolds.

## Lesson 3: Scaffold Safety Measures

Let’s shift our focus to the final lesson: scaffold safety measures.

One out of every three deaths in construction results from fatal falls. Let’s cover key safety measures.

### Key Points

**Manufacturer consistency**  
If you have scaffolds from two or more manufacturers, do not mix and match components. Consistency protects structural integrity and worker safety.

**Metal consistency**  
Do not use different metals for scaffold elements. This guideline helps ensure stability and reliability.

**Platform stability**  
Platform stability is a pledge to provide a secure foundation for every task performed at heights. A stable platform is the cornerstone of scaffold safety.

**Guardrails and toe boards**  
Guardrails and toe boards are frontline defenses against falls, providing a secure perimeter for workers.

**Fall protection**  
Fall protection is not just a requirement. It is a lifeline. It ensures workers have measures in place to prevent falls and reduce harm if a fall occurs.

**Safe access**  
Safe and efficient access helps ensure that every ascent and descent is secure.

**Post-fall impact inspection**  
Any system involved in a fall arrest must be removed immediately and inspected thoroughly before reuse. Safety is not only prevention, it is also post-incident diligence.

Now, review the study questions.

## Common Scaffold Injuries

Let’s understand the seriousness of scaffold incidents by reviewing common injuries:

- Traumatic brain injuries  
- Spinal cord injuries  
- Amputations  
- Broken bones  
- Lacerations  

The truth is: with the right precautions, serious injuries and fatal falls can be prevented.

## Essential Scaffold Safety Tips

- Stay up to date on current and proposed OSHA scaffold regulations.
- Ensure scaffold design and construction align with OSHA requirements.
- Keep scaffold suspension ropes, body belts or harness systems, and drop lines protected from hot or corrosive substances.
- Wear personal fall protection equipment as required.
- Before each use, inspect:
  - Scaffolds  
  - Scaffold components  
  - Personal fall protection equipment
- Anchor drop lines for body belt or harness systems and tiebacks using structurally sound portions of buildings or other structures.
- Follow the scaffold manufacturer’s guidance exactly for assembly, rigging, and use.
