# Shepherd Learning - Transcript Library

Transcripts now live in individual markdown files so they are easier to manage.
The app can load these files directly, or you can paste into:

- /transcripts?course=osha-foundations
- /transcripts?course=ladder-safety

Folders
- `transcripts/osha-foundations/`
- `transcripts/ladder-safety/`
