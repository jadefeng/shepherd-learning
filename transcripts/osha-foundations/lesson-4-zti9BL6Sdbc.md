# Module 4: Cranes and Rigging

## Transcript

Welcome back, fellow learners.

In the last video for **Module 3**, we talked about **hazard communication**. Here is a quick recap: mists, vapors, dust, aerosols, and training, which is a course of study in which employees are instructed on safe work practices.

Now, we will begin **Module 4**. Make sure you have subscribed and watched the previous modules to follow along easily.

## Module 4 Overview

Module 4 is an exciting and informative topic that covers the basics of **cranes and rigging**.

This module is intended for workers who want to learn about:
- Cranes  
- Derricks  
- Hoists  
- Aerial lifts  
- Conveyors  

This module covers topics included in **OSHA 29 CFR 1926.550 Subpart N**.

## Module 4 Lessons

This module is comprised of three lessons:

1. General Standards  
2. Cranes  
3. Cranes, Personnel Platforms, and Rigging

## Essential Key Terms

**Accident**  
A harmful event that is unexpected or occurs without apparent cause.

**Act**  
A statute, decree, or enactment resulting from a decision by a legislative body.

**Block**  
Sheaves or grooved pulleys in a frame with a hook, eye, and strap.

**Boom**  
An inclined spar, strut, or other long member supporting the hoisting tackle.

**Boom Angle Indicator**  
A device that measures the angle of the boom and the weight of lifted objects, including load blocks, hooks, wire ropes, rigging, and ancillary attachments.

**Boom Stops**  
Devices used to restrict the angle of the boom when it reaches its highest position.

**Brake**  
A device used to slow or stop motion by friction or power.

**Counterweight**  
Weights that balance loads and provide crane stability.

**Crane**  
A rotating structure mounted on rubber tires or crawler treads used for lifting, lowering, and horizontal movement of loads.

**Deck**  
The revolving superstructure or turntable bed.

**Drum**  
A cylindrical member around which cables are wound for raising and lowering loads.

**Hoist**  
A device used to lift and lower loads.

**Jib**  
An extension attached to the boom point to provide additional boom length for lifting specified loads.

**Outriggers**  
Support members attached to the crane’s carrier frame to level and stabilize the crane.

**PCSA**  
Power Crane and Shovel Association.

**Pendants**  
Stationary wire ropes used to support the boom.

**Radius**  
The horizontal distance from the axis of rotation of the crane’s superstructure to the center of the suspended load.

**Standards**  
Measures of comparison for quantitative or qualitative values; criteria.

**Superstructure**  
The rotating frame, gantry, boom, or other operating equipment.

## Lesson 1: General Standards

### Key Points

- Employers must designate a **competent person** to inspect all machinery and equipment before and during use to ensure safe operating conditions.
- All deficiencies must be promptly repaired, and defective parts must be replaced before equipment is used.
- OSHA analysis of crane accidents in general industry and construction identified an average of **71 fatalities per year**.
- OSHA studies show that nearly **30 percent of work-related electrocutions** involve cranes.
- Although mechanical failures account for only **11 percent** of crane accident causes, they often result in serious accidents involving injuries, fatalities, significant material costs, and negative media coverage.
- Studies frequently show that mechanical failures result from a lack of preventive maintenance or insufficient training and personnel experience.

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 2: Cranes

### Key Points

- Crane operators must know the crane’s load limits and the approximate weight of the load to be lifted.
- Once load weight is known, operators must verify lift calculations and ensure the load is within the crane’s rated capacity.
- Employees must stay out of the crane’s swing radius.
- OSHA recommends completely barricading the entire swing radius to prevent employee access.
- A boom angle indicator must be visible to the crane operator.
- Cranes must be level within **1 percent** and positioned on firm footing.
- A competent person must conduct and document a thorough **annual inspection** of hoisting machinery.
- OSHA requires:
  - Visual inspections before and during each shift  
  - An additional inspection at least once per month
- Crane operators must be certified for the specific type of crane they operate.
- Operators must receive on-the-job training specific to workplace conditions.
- Wire ropes must not be used if:
  - Six randomly distributed broken wires exist in one lay of running rope  
  - Three broken wires are present in one strand in one lay  
  - One-third of the original diameter of outside wires is lost  
  - There is kinking, crushing, birdcaging, or other rope distortion  
  - There is evidence of heat damage  
  - Standing ropes have more than two broken wires in one lay beyond end connections  
  - There is more than one broken wire at an end connection

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 3: Cranes, Personnel Platforms, and Rigging

### Key Points

- Always ensure crane loads do not exceed the manufacturer’s rated capacity.
- Each crane must have a load rating chart with clearly visible letters and figures, securely fixed so the operator can easily read it.
- Permanently installed cranes or derricks on barges must meet current design criteria and capacity limitations.
- Cranes with variable-angle booms must have a visible boom angle indicator.
- The suspension system and personnel platform must be designed by a qualified engineer or a competent person experienced in structural design.
- Access gates must not swing outward during hoisting and must have restraining devices.
- Only qualified welders familiar with required materials and weld types may weld personnel platforms.
- Bridles and rigging used for personnel hoisting must not be used for other purposes.
- When the crane engine is running and the platform is occupied, the operator must remain at the controls.
- Employees must not be hoisted during bad weather or when unsafe conditions exist.
- If a dangerous situation arises while employees are hoisted, they must be safely grounded immediately.

Now, review the study questions.
