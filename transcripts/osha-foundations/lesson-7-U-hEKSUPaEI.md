# Module 6: Hand and Power Tools

## Transcript

Welcome back, fellow learners, to a tools-handling journey.

First, let’s rewind for a quick recap of the previous module. Imagine a world where safety isn’t just a priority, but a mindset. When it comes to safeguarding yourself against potential injuries, especially around the face and eyes, having the right protective gear matters.

Now, as we gear up for this module, I invite you to join us by hitting the **subscribe** button and ringing the **bell icon**. One word of advice: make sure you’ve caught up on the gems shared in the previous modules.

## Module Overview

This module explores the basics of **hand and power tools**. We will also discuss OSHA’s role in preventing and eliminating work-related illnesses and injuries.

Hand and power tools are woven into our daily lives and help us accomplish tasks that might otherwise be daunting. Yet these simple tools can create serious hazards and lead to severe injuries if they are not used or maintained properly.

Paying special attention to hand and power tool safety is essential to reducing or eliminating these risks.

## Module Lessons

This module unfolds across three lessons:

1. Safe use of hand and power tools  
2. Classification of tools  
3. Mechanical power transmission apparatus

## Key Terms

**PSI (pounds per square inch)**

**Training**  
The process of teaching or learning a skill.

## Lesson 1: Safe Use of Hand and Power Tools

In this lesson, we focus on the employer’s responsibility to ensure the safety of tools and equipment used by employees.

### Key Points

- Employers must not issue or permit the use of unsafe hand tools.
- Employers must provide training on the proper use and handling of tools and equipment.

Hazards often arise from misuse and improper maintenance. Specific safety measures can reduce risk significantly.

### Tool Safety Switches

**Constant Pressure Switch**  
Used on circular saws, chainsaws, and percussion tools without positive accessory holding means. This switch ensures the tool stops when pressure is released.

**Momentary Contact Off Switch**  
Used on handheld power drills, tappers, fastener drivers, grinders, sanders, reciprocating saws, and saber saws. This switch allows quick shutdown with a single motion and adds an extra layer of safety.

### Types of Power Tools

- **Electric power tools:** Powered by electricity  
  - Corded tools  
  - Cordless tools (rechargeable batteries)

- **Pneumatic (air-powered) tools:** Powered by compressed air, commonly used in workshops and industries where compressed air is available.

- **Hydraulic power tools:** Powered by hydraulic pressure, often used for heavy-duty applications such as hydraulic jacks and presses.

- **Gas-powered tools:** Powered by gasoline or other fuels, often used outdoors (chainsaws, leaf blowers, lawnmowers).

- **Powder-actuated tools:** Use explosive powder charges to drive fasteners into hard materials, often used in construction (for example, attaching framing to concrete).

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 2: Classification of Tools

In this lesson, we focus on an essential part of tool safety: **guards**.

Guards are critical for maintaining visibility and protecting workers from harm.

### Key Points

- Never remove guards. It’s not just about visibility, it’s about protection.

A real-world example: pneumatic nail guns and staplers with automatic fastener feeds should have a safety device on the muzzle. This prevents the tool from ejecting fasteners unless the muzzle is firmly pressed against the work surface.

### Safe Operating Pressure

The manufacturer’s specified safe operating pressure for hoses, pipes, valves, filters, and fittings is not a suggestion, it’s a requirement. Exceeding these limits can damage tools and create serious hazards.

### PPE and Pneumatic Tools

- Eye protection is required when using pneumatic tools.
- When using jackhammers, hearing protection is also needed.

### Compressed Air Hose Safety

For compressed air hoses with an inside diameter greater than 1/2 inch, a safety device is required to reduce the risk of uncontrolled whipping if the hose fails.

Pneumatic devices must be securely fastened to air hoses to prevent accidental disconnections.

### Compressed Air for Cleaning

Compressed air is a tool, not a broom. However, compressed air may be used for cleaning only when:
- Pressure is reduced to less than 30 PSI  
- Effective chip guarding is used  
- Appropriate PPE is worn  

Now, review the study questions.

## Lesson 3: Mechanical Power Transmission Apparatus

In this lesson, we cover key points to ensure safety and proper machine functioning.

### Key Points

- Guards are your allies. Never remove guards while equipment is in operation.
- Always follow lockout and tagout procedures during maintenance.

### Flywheels and Guards

- Any part of a flywheel extending through the working floor must be enclosed.
- Guards above working areas must be strong enough to contain parts in case of failure.

### Safe Practices Around Guards

- Never place your hands past protective guards.
- Keep all metal free from burrs and sharp edges.

### Shafting Safety

- Continuous shafting must be secured against excessive endwise movement.
- Inclined and vertical shafts, especially inclined idler shafts, must be securely positioned.

### Pulleys, Belts, and Barriers

- Cracked or broken pulleys must not be used.
- Provide guides to prevent belts from leaving pulleys where clearance is insufficient.
- Bar passage between horizontal belt runs to prevent accidents.
- Guard overhead chain and link belt drives the same way as horizontal belts.

### Clearance Requirements

- Maintain a minimum clearance of **7 feet** between an inclined belt and the floor outside of a guard.

### Avoid Projections

- Do not allow projecting set screws or oil cups in revolving pulleys.
- Revolving collars must be cylindrical with no screws or bolts projecting beyond the perimeter.

### Protection From Falling Hazards

- Protect areas where drive mechanisms extend over other machines or manually operated sprockets.

### Safe Oiling Practices

- Use hinged or sliding self-closing covers for frequent oiling.
- Attach oil feed tubes to points not easily accessible during machine motion.

### Belt Shifters and Idle Belts

- If not directly over a machine, cut off belt shifter handles at **6 feet 6 inches** above floor level.
- Use belt perches such as brackets or rollers to keep idle belts away from shafts.

Now, review the study questions.

## Safety Statistics and Practical Tips

Let’s look at some eye-opening statistics:

- Hand tools contribute to **6%** of all compensated work injuries and **14%** of non-compensated work injuries.
- More than **22,000 accidents** involve workers using nail guns.
- In the United States, hand tool injuries send over **115,000 people** to the emergency room each year.

Safety is not just a guideline, it’s a responsibility we owe to ourselves and our colleagues.

### Practical Safety Tips

- Disconnect tools when they are not in use, being serviced, cleaned, or when changing accessories. This simple step can prevent accidents.
- Maintain a safe distance between tools and people not directly involved in the work.
- Secure your work using clamps or a vise to free both hands for safe operation.
- Do not hold the switch button while carrying a plugged-in tool to prevent accidental activation.
- Keep tools sharp and clean. Good condition improves both safety and performance.
- Avoid loose clothing and jewelry around moving parts.
- Remove damaged electric tools from service immediately and tag them clearly: **DO NOT USE**.
