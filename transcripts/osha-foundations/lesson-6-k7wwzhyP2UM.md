## Module Overview

In this module, we’re focusing on **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** from **OSHA 1926 Subpart E**.

This module emphasizes the preciousness of every human life. Despite this, thousands of workers face fatalities due to negligence and inadequate safety measures, especially in the construction industry. Our goal here is to minimize or eliminate these tragedies.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires employers to safeguard employees from workplace hazards using proper **engineering controls** or **work practices**. When these controls are not feasible, **personal protective equipment** becomes crucial.

Our focus in this module is to provide a foundational understanding of OSHA’s role in preventing work-related casualties and fatalities.

## Lesson 1: Protecting Employees from Workplace Hazards

Do you want to maximize protection for yourself and others in the workplace? To ensure maximum protection, employers and employees must collaborate to establish and maintain a safe work environment.

### Key Points

- Employers are responsible for:
  - Hazard assessment and identification  
  - Providing appropriate PPE  
  - Training employees on PPE use  
  - PPE maintenance  
  - Regular program evaluations  

- According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), **three out of every five injured workers** were not wearing eye protection during their accidents.

- Employers must protect employees from:
  - Falling objects  
  - Hazardous substances  
  - Noise exposure  
  This should be done using engineering controls and, when necessary, PPE.

- Work practice controls (a form of administrative control) modify how tasks are performed.

- Employees must:
  - Follow PPE usage instructions  
  - Inspect PPE daily  
  - Ensure compatibility when multiple types of PPE are used together  
  - Understand glove selection based on tasks and material resistance  

- Proper PPE training is crucial. Retraining is required when an employee has not gained the necessary skills.

- Training documentation is mandatory and must clearly include:
  - The certified employee’s name  
  - Training date  
  - Subject matter  

- Determining training adequacy and providing retraining when needed are key elements of an effective PPE program.

Now, review the study questions to reinforce your understanding.

## Lesson 2: Head, Eye, Face, Hearing, Foot, Hand, and Body Protection

Let’s cover essential protection types and the key points you need to know.

### Head Protection

Hard hats are critical for head protection. **Bump caps do not meet hard hat requirements.**

Hard hats come in three classes:

- **Class G (General):**  
  Protects from impact and penetration caused by falling objects.  
  Rated for up to **2,200 volts** (low-voltage electrical protection).

- **Class E (Electrical):**  
  Provides increased resistance against high-voltage shocks up to **20,000 volts**.

- **Class C (Conductive):**  
  Typically made from aluminum and designed for impact protection from falling objects and debris.  
  **Provides no electrical protection.**

### Eye and Face Protection

Having proper face and eye protection is non-negotiable. Examples include:

- **Safety goggles:** Protect eyes from flying debris and chemical hazards.  
- **Full face shields:** Protect the entire face from splashes, sparks, and impacts.

### Hearing Protection

Hearing protection protects against noise-induced hearing damage:

- **Earplugs**  
- **Ear muffs**

### Hand Protection

Hand protection options include:

- Chemical-resistant gloves  
- Electrical-insulating gloves  
- Cut-resistant gloves  
- Leather gloves  
- Insulated gloves  

### Foot Protection

Foot protection options include:

- Steel-toe boots  
- Composite-toe boots  
- Metatarsal guards  
- Electrical hazard boots  
- Slip-resistant boots  

Now, review the study questions to reinforce your understanding.

## Lesson 3: Choosing Personal Protective Equipment

Did you know that the leading cause of eye injuries is not wearing proper eye protection, or using inadequate gear?

### Key Points

- **Goggles** protect eyes from impacts, dust, splashes, and even intense laser light.  
  Laser safety goggles exist and are used for certain hazards.

- A key statistic: only **1% of nearly 770 workers** who suffered facial injuries were using face protection at the time.

### Respirators

Respirators cover the nose and mouth, or even the entire face and head, to keep airborne hazards out of the respiratory system.

Before an employer provides a respirator:
- A written respiratory protection plan must be in place.  
- A healthcare professional must medically evaluate the employee.

Inspect your respirator every time you use it. If something seems off, get it fixed or replaced immediately.

### Welding Protection

A welding helmet or hand shield is essential for arc welding and cutting operations. Helpers and attendants also need proper eye protection.

### Noise Protection

Noise can be a serious hazard. OSHA sets limits around **90 dB** in construction. When noise exceeds **85 dBA**, employers must implement a hearing conservation program and appropriate protection.

### Gloves

For chemical exposure, choose gloves based on manufacturer recommendations.

Hands are the second most injured body part in the workplace. Gloves also protect against:
- Rough edges  
- Extreme temperatures  
- Machinery risks  

### Safety Belts and Safety Nets

Safety belts and nets are critical for fall protection. (Refer to the fall protection module for more detail.)

Safety nets must be tested and properly installed before work begins. Many factors matter, including mesh size and impact resistance. Safety nets must meet specific standards to ensure effectiveness.

Now, review the study questions.

## PPE Statistics and Why It Matters

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only **31% of construction laborers** use PPE, leaving many workers vulnerable to preventable accidents.

OSHA emphasizes that proper PPE use can prevent nearly **38%** of occupational injuries or diseases. Tragically, **12% to 14%** of total disability-related injuries are attributed to employees not wearing the right protective gear.

Consider the consequences:
- Hearing loss without earplugs or ear muffs  
- Lacerations to hands and fingers without gloves  
- Serious head injuries without hard hat protection  

But here’s the powerful truth: we can rewrite this story. Through awareness, education, and accessible, user-friendly PPE, we can build a future where every worker is safeguarded and safety becomes the norm.

## Essential PPE Tips

- Choose PPE appropriate for the specific hazards in your workplace.  
- Educate yourself and your team on correct use, maintenance, and limitations of PPE.  
- Inspect PPE regularly for damage, wear, and tear.  
- Ensure proper fit and comfort. Follow manufacturer sizing and adjustment guidelines.  
- Store PPE in a clean, dry area to prevent damage or contamination.  
- Encourage a culture of reporting issues or discomfort related to PPE.  

Remember: PPE is not just equipment. It is a promise of safety and a shield against adversity.
